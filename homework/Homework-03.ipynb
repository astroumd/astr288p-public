    "Codes not in python will obviously be much harder to explain in a notebook. That should not stop you from using a non-python code. In those cases use some Markdown cells to document your work, so I can in principle reproduce your results. You are allowed to create some png files and include those. See the example in the **orbits-03** notebook [here](../notebooks/orbits-03.ipynb). In that case I would suggest you name your png files (or any supporting files) after your username on ursa. For example \"teuben01.png\", \"teuben02.tab\", \"teuben03.fits\", ...."
