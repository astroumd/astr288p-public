Lecture 2:  UNIX
================

command line unix vs. desktop unix ('window manager')
  - GUI: a dime a dozen (and they keep changing)
  - GUI: Mac (aqua) and Linux (X11)
  - GUI: Linux has many many window managers (twm, fvwm, enlightenment, gnome, kde, unity, plasma)
  - GUI: Linux is changing from using X11 to Wayland
  - CLI: one and only one (minor differences do remain between Mac and Linux)


Login shell in a terminal:
  - xterm
  - Gnome Terminal
  - emacs "M-x shell"

Shell options (as defined in /etc/passwd, see /etc/shells)           [does MacOS obey this?]
  - bash  (sh: bourne shell)
  - tcsh  (csh: C-shell)
  - ksh   (korn shell)
  - xonsh (pythonesque shell, cf. ipython)

Persistent shells with session management (cf. VNC)
  - screen
  - tmux

bash:
  - interactive vs. login shell
  - login:
	/etc/profile
	~/.bash_profile
	~/.bash_login
	~/.profile
  - interactive
        /etc/bash.bashrc
	~/.bashrc

   	    	       grep $USER /etc/passwd 
                       ps
