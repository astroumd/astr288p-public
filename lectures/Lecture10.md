Lecture 10: ODE's and FITTING
=============================

## Homework assignments

Next week, April 17, the homework-02 assignment is due, notebook style, **due on Apr 17 before class**!

The final homework is due on May 8, and will be a computation with
your selection of a package from http://ascl.net (pick something you
like as science, not something that looks easy).  There will be in
in-class discussion on the cases. This homework is **due on May 8, at
noon** , so I can prepare the lecture with your results a few hours
later.  Don't pick athena (ascl:1010.014) and don't pick a code you
had already used for your research!

In case of doubt: ask me!

You can work alone, or in groups of 2.

Instead of browsing through the ASCL, you can also try using their [random code from ASCL](http://ascl.net/code/random) service,
and keep on clicking on the *Another Random Code* button!  You can also use the full text search button in the top right, and
browse through the results.

A few suggestions (I have not verified how well they are suited):
1. AllenTools (py)
2. JSPAM (f,java,js)
3. ComputePK (perhaps)
4. slimplectic (py)
5. Quickclump (py)
6. gala (py)

In your discussion you should keep in mind:
1. **document everything you do!**
1. is the documentation sufficient to select this for your project?
1. installation instructions, do I need another compiler or tool?
1. does it come with example files to run the code?
1. do they give a regression test (i.e. can I verify it works)?
1. are there other codes that do (almost) the same?
1. once it has produced results, what can you do with those?

## Last Week addenda

* **orbits-01** : computing orbits as an ODE: handcrafted vs. scipy.integrate.odeint

## New notebooks:


* **orbits-02** : computing orbits using an open source python package, galpy
* **orbits-03** : computing orbits using an open source C package, NEMO
* **fitting-01** : model fitting
