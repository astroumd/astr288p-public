Lecture 7:  ASTROPY
===================



## Last Week Homework




## Astronomical Data


* Images:  FITS files.  (a new file **ngc6503.cube.fits** was added to your astr288p/data directory)
  * **ds9**: http://ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html
    Supports 3D cubes: a 3D slicer comes up autmatically. To bring up a spectrum, select Edit->Region, double click the region (or Region->Get Information)
    and set Analysis->Plot3D (save in Preferences -> Region -> Auto Plot 3D to make it persistent)
  * **ginga**: https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    Supports 3D cubes, but perhaps not as intuitive as ds9
  
* Tables  (astropy http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/unified.html)
  * ascii tables
  * FITS tables
  * VO tables
* 



## Continuing notebooks:

* **n6503-case1** : analyzing the new ngc6503.cube.fits using astropy
* **n6503-case2** : analyzing the new ngc6503.cube.fits using radio-astro-tools (experimental)
* **n6503-orbits** : theoretical models what to expect of a galactic velocity field

## Other Interesting Notebooks:

*  GW150914 merging black hole : https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html
