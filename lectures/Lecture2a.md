# Lecture 2a:  A few comments after Lecture2 :

- if there are words and concepts that you don't understand, I need to know!!

- echo $SHELL

This will show what login shell you are using. We are supposed to use /bin/bash. The command **chsh**
(**ch**ange **sh**ell) can change your default login shell on linux. On a mac, this is more
complicated because mac doesn't honor the traditional /etc/passwd file.


- the unix (bash) shell:  
  - interactive vs. login shell
  - linux vs. macosx have subtle differences which type of shell you get!

- Create your class directory in    **~/ASTR288P**
- Create your class git repo in     **~/ASTR288P/astr288p**
- Ideally keep your work out of the git repo!

- we will discuss a weekly list of papers/URLs related to 288P

- HW1 will be in-class on Feb 20.  HW2 will be as scheduled, due on Mar 6
