Lecture 9: ORBITS and ODE's
===========================

## Homework assignments

Next week, April 10, will be a homework assignment, notebook style, **due on Apr 17 before class**!

The final homework will be your selection of a package from http://ascl.net (pick something you like as science, not
something that looks easy).  There will be in in-class discussion on the cases. This homework is
**due on May 8, at noon** , so I can prepare the lecture with your results a few hours later.
Don't pick athena (ascl:1010.014) and don't pick a code you had already used for your research!

In case of doubt: ask me!

You can work alone, or in groups of 2.

## Last Week addenda

* **n6503-orbits**: scipy.interpolate.interp2d - forwards projection


## New notebooks:

* **orbits-01** : computing orbits as an ODE: handcrafted vs. scipy.integrate.odeint
* **orbits-02** : computing orbits using an open source python package, galpy
* **orbits-03** : computing orbits using an open source C package, NEMO
