Lecture 8: ORBITS and ODE's
===========================



## Last Week notebook:

* n6503-case1 : n6503_rms.png produce several methods to estimate the RMS as function of channel.
* n6503-case1 : smoothing
* n6503-case1 : saving your results in a FITS file



## New notebooks:

* **n6503-orbits** : theoretical models what to expect of a galactic velocity field
* **orbits-01** : computing orbits as an ODE
